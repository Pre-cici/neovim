---
--- A Language Server Protocol implementation for Ruff, an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. It can be installed via `pip`.
---
--- ```sh
--- pip install ruff
--- ```
---
--- **Available in Ruff `v0.4.5` in beta and stabilized in Ruff `v0.5.3`.**
---
--- This is the new built-in language server written in Rust. It supports the same feature set as `ruff-lsp`, but with superior performance and no installation required. Note that the `ruff-lsp` server will continue to be maintained until further notice.
---
--- Server settings can be provided via:
---
--- ```lua
--- vim.lsp.config('ruff', {
---   init_options = {
---     settings = {
---       -- Server settings should go here
---     }
---   }
--- })
--- ```
---
--- Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/) for more details.

        end
